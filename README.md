## Optimized-Frequency-Cap-for-Ad-Impressions
This case study analyzes ad impression frequency for app install campaigns. It identifies a specific number of impressions discovered through EDA that optimizes installs while minimizing user annoyance.

However, this number is just a starting point for further optimization. By adopting this approach, campaign managers can achieve a balance between targeted advertising, user engagement, and overall campaign effectiveness. Further segmentation or A/B testing can be used to refine the optimal impression frequency for different user groups.
